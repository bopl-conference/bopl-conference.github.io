<h2 id="injenia">The essence from cloud digital natives that effectively powers real Digital Transformation in the industry</h2>
<small>17:30 - 18:00</small>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Digital Transformation has been definitely one of CIOs top priorities in the
last years. Microservices have meanwhile become one of the primary companions
and a must-to-have option to implement Digital Transformation programs. It's
time for a short, opinionated, retrospective on the Italian industrial landscape
and an outlook on what cloud natives and their innovations can do to foster and
power software lifecycle transformational programs to support valuable outcomes
on the path to customer-centricity.
