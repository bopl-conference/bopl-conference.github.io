## Edge Microservices and Industrial IOT for Digital Manufacturing
<small>17:00 - 17:30</small>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Philip Morris International is scaling the integration of IIoT technologies in Factory Floor operation enabled by PMI Industrial Cloud which is a continuum of Edge and Cloud technologies merging IT/OT, underpinned by a combination of software stacks mainly open-source and open standards.

Several Use Cases have been already successfully implemented:

- HVAC energy optimization with Reinforcement Learning
- Autonomous Machine with Real-Time Quality Control
- Edge and Big-Data cross-functional Analytics

IndustrialCloud architecture is underpinned by digital best practices (DevOps, SRE, Microservices, Microfrontend, Kubernetes, and Service-Mesh) which are consistently applied to Manufacturing and OT enabling complex real-time data processing or advanced data analytics.

A critical success factor to successfully operate Industrial IOT real time application is the capability of distributing workload, including microservices, to edge technologies and devices.
