The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central 
to the aims and goals of SIGPLAN; these require an environment that recognizes the 
inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and 
mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. 
For these reasons, SIGPLAN is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience, 
and abides by the [ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment).

Conference participants violating these standards may be sanctioned or expelled from the 
conference, at the discretion of the conference organizers. Conference organizers are 
requested to report serious incidents to the Conference Chair.

A useful resource is the [Geek Feminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy), which includes models for public 
announcements and guidance for conference staff.
