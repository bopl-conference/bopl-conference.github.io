Please use this form to request an invitation to the PLDI 2020 Slack workspace. Enter the email address that you used when you registered for PLDI.

The Slack workspace is where you will receive instructions on how to access the conference content, and it is where all conference discussion and Q&A will take place.

IMPORTANT: Please use your full name when you accept the Slack invitation. At a physical conference you would have a name badge, and at our virtual conference it is important to replicate this so that all conference attendees know with whom they are communicating.
