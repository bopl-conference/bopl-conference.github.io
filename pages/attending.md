	Joining instructions for BOPL
</div>

If you registered for BOPL before the registration deadline then you should have received an email with joining instructions. 
If this email did not arrive then here is its content:

Action required

* Read the [ACM Policy Against Harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) - you must abide by this at all times during the conference
* Read the [BOPL Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.html) - you must abide by this at all times during the conference
* Get access to the conference _Slack workspace_: communication about the conference will be via Slack

Please be sure to use your real name as your Slack handle for BOPL 2020. 
At a physical conference you would wear a name badge. 
Your Slack handle is your virtual name badge, and it is important for all conference attendees to know with whom they are communicating.

    How virtual BOPL will work
    Hallway interaction at BOPL

The main BOPL conference will be Wednesday, 17 June through Friday, 19 June. Several exciting events that would usually be co-located with BOPL will also be held virtually during 15-16 June; see “Tracks” above for details.

The BOPL technical program will be single track and will run 12h/day during 17-19 June. This means that it covers plenty of time zones! It also means that you can pick and choose the sessions you’d like to attend without the constraints imposed by parallel tracks. Check out the program.

The technical program will run as a webinar. After registering, you will receive details on how to access the webinar shortly after registration closes on 5 June. If you are in a country where YouTube is available you will access the webinar via a YouTube live stream. If YouTube is not available to you, you will be able to access the webinar via Zoom.

During each session a talk video for each paper will be broadcast to the webinar, after which one of the paper’s authors will answer questions from conference attendees live, moderated by a session chair.

There is also an “Ask me Anything” track, where several leading lights in the Programming Languages field will be available live to answer your most burning questions! Check out the Ask Me Anything program, which will also be delivered via a live stream using YouTube or Zoom depending on territory.

We will use Slack for communication among attendees; you will be invited to our Slack workspace after registration closes.

We are still brainstorming ideas for ways to achieve some of the social and networking aspects of a physical conference. -->
