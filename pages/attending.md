#### Zoom Meetings Guidelines

One of the members of the BOPL organization will be the host of the Zoom room (role HOST). 

**The HOST performs the following tasks**:

- Management of the Zoom rooms (e.g., create, delete, edit, …).  
- The HOST sends the conference daily schedule (with the link and passcode to participate) to all the registered ATTENDEES the day before the session (e.g., schedule of Monday the 7th will be sent on Sunday the 6th). 
- Check-in of the ATTENDEES from the waiting room. 
- The HOST provides technical assistance to the Session Chair and the PRESENTER (e.g. mute/activate the microphone of the ATTENDEES, activation of the screen sharing, technical problems assistance). In case of problems of technical nature that are beyond the competence of the HOST, the intervention of the official Zoom assistance will be requested. 

The Session Chair will be the co-host of the Zoom room (role CO-HOST). 

**The CO-HOST**: 

- Introduces the PRESENTER. 
- Manages the timing of the presentation. 
- Selects the questions from the official channels (Zoom chat + Slack channel) and moderates the communication between ATTENDEES and PRESENTER. 

ATTENDEES may request the activation of the microphone to communicate, through the hand-raise (✋) function, offered by the Zoom platform. 

#### Slack Workspace Guidelines 

Communication between ATTENDEES, BOPL organization and PC is managed using the dedicated [Slack workspace](https://bopl2020organisation.slack.com/). 

PC and [BOPL organization](https://bopl.cs.unibo.it/organization) are the administrators of the workspace (role ADMIN). 

**Any ADMIN can**: 

- Create and remove public channels. 
- Subscribe or unsubscribe ATTENDEES from the created channels. 
- Add new administrators. 

ADMINs are encouraged to animate the channels and foster discussions deemed of interest.
